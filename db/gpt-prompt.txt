- Economic news: big market moves, interest rate announcements from the ECB or Fed, major economic or fiscal policy changes, unexpected economic indicators.
- Geopolitics: US-China relations, EU policy, NATO, etc.
- Semiconductor industry and adjacent industries. Companies such as TSMC, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, ASML, Applied Materials.

Additional criteria:
- Ignore vague headlines and opinion pieces.
- The user lives in Europe and is not interested in the minutiae of US politics or US culture wars.
- Ignore articles about Donald Trump and the Republican primaries.

For headlines that qualify, return a JSON object with a "news" property, which is array of objects that have an "ID" and "headline" field (both copied from the input), a "confidence" field (0-100) and a "reason" field (concise, in a few words).
